* Thu Aug 03 2006  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.7 - bug fix and a few enhancements release
  + Important steps:
    - Prior to the update, make sure all elements (instance_attributes
      etc) in the CRM configuration have valid id attributes, or set the
      ignore_dtd option to true. Otherwise, the new version will refuse
      to start.
  + SECURITY FIX:
    - Remote Denial of Service attack (#195068, CVE-2006-3121).
    - Local Denial of Service attack (#194444, CVE-2006-3815).
      (actually fixed in 2.0.6)
  + Enhancements:
    - Improved log messages.
    - ptest can now read compressed XML directly. Do not include
      optional actions and dependancies in ptest output by default.
    - crm_resource will now warn and demand exact specification when
      trying to modify an attribute while several sets are present.
  + Bugfixes:
    - Small fix from Serge Dubrouski <sergefd@gmail.com> for one
      annoying problem when PostgreSQL isn't installed on a box and one
      tries to run the script.
    - stonithd log message did not always indicate an error (OSDL 1379)
    - lrmd now limits itself to a maximum of 4 child processes, to avoid
      overloading the node and causing too long delays.
    - Improvements and fixes for Solaris 10.
    - pengine: Processing of pending probes; should not be treated as if
      the resource is running or in a known state.
    - target_role now is only taken into account for managed resources.
    - cib: Detect more cases where the nodes section needs to be
      refreshed.
    - More accurately determine node status. (OSDL 1369)
    - Filter out stop requests that would require a resource to be
      added. (OSDL 1369)
    - Send filtered resource "stops" as successes as to not block
      waiting for filtered actions.
    - By default pass the TE graph via IPC until its too large for IPC
      to deal with, only then fall back to passing via the disk.
    - Stopping of stonith resources can never require stonith, even if
      the node its running on failed; prevent graph loop. (OSDL 1376)
    - STONITH events need to inputs to start events (not stops), to
      avoid graph loop in combination with "stop before" dependencies
      (ie, groups).
    - crmd: Dont stall the FSA if we try to invoke the TE after we've
      stopped it.
    - Always unpack the correct part of a diff operation; diffs should
      now apply in more cases, reducing the need for full refreshs.
    - Correctly observe --disable-snmp-subagent during build.
    - In some states the membership is invalid and shouldn't be
      referenced. (OSDL 1377)
    - Fix a use-before-null-check issue in lrmd. (Coverity #48)
    - OCF Resource Agents outside the default path were incorrectly
      found to be not executable.
    - ccm: hostcache and delnodecache files should not be authoritative
      if autojoin is disabled. (OSDL 1226)
    - With autojoin, llm_get_nodecount() can't return the real max nodes
      anymore, this may cause memory corruption. (OSDL 1382)
    - Fix a memory corruption in membership layer, more frequently
      observed with larger (>5) clusters.
    - Change the default api-auth for pingd to uid=root
    - Dummy RA now OCF compliant.
    - Fix pingd RA metadata to be XML compliant.
    - Actually use RPMREL in the spec file.
  + KNOWN BUGS:
    - When running a cluster of nodes of very different speeds temporary
      membership anomalies may occasionally be seen.  These correct
      themselves and don't appear to be harmful.  They typically
      include a message something like this:
      WARN: Ignoring HA message (op=vote) from XXX: not in our membership list

  + Added the ability to start/stop groups from the GUI
  + Fixed a few monitoring bugs in the Apache resource agent

	resource agents.  This is because the netmask must be specified
	in CIDR format.  The new name is cidr_netmask.  It will continue

    + the GUI core dumps when run using AIX-based X servers

* Sun Apr 23 2006  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.5 - significant bug fixes and a few feature deficits fixed
  + various portability fixes
  + enable GUI to run with pygtk 2.4
  + significant GUI improvements and speedups
  + numerous logging improvements (generally much quieter)
  + speed up CIB processing by writing it to disk asynchronously
  + add CIB on-disk checksums
  + removed dependency on openssl
  + added "failure stickiness" to the CIB/CRM
  + Several fixes to the membership code

  + Improved detection of "old" events that should be ignored by the PE
    (ensures resource monitoring is active when required)
  + Better detection of required and/or optimal behaviour in mixed
    (and formerly mixed) clusters
  + LRM now supports multiple concurrent monitor operations
  + Optional startup & runtime enforcement of DTD validation
    (Invalid changes are rejected)

  + Minimum required version for performing a rolling upgrade of a
    crm yes" cluster to 2.0.5 is 2.0.4
  + Changed traditional_compression to default to NO.  This new default
	is not compatible in mixed clusters running version 2.0.0-2.0.2.
	If you are upgrading a CRM-based cluster to >= 2.0.5, you
	have to go through 2.0.4 anyway (for other reasons), so this
	shouldn't cause any additional difficulties.
	Non-CRM clusters shouldn't be affected by this because only
	CRM packets are large enough to be compressed.

* Fri Feb 10 2006  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.3 - Bug fixes and significant new features.
  + Management Daemon/Library and GUI client
    + provide a management library for manamgement daemon and CIM provider
    + provide a management daemon and a basic GUI management tool
  + CIM enablement
    + CIM (Common Information Model) enablement - works with
      sblim-sfcb, OpenWBEM, and Pegasus CIMOMs
    - not yet compiled into our binary RPMs because of dependencies
  + CRM (Cluster Resource Manager) General
    + All shutdowns go via the PE/TE - preserves inter-resource ordering
    + Support for future changes to the CIB (depreciation of cib_fragment)
    + Overhaul of IPC and HA channel callback logic
    + Many improvments to the quality and quantity (reduced) of logging
  + CRMd
    + Timerless elections - when everyone has voted we're done
    + Use the replace notification from the CIB to re-update our copy with 
      our view of our peers.
    + Reliably detect if the LRM connection is still active.
    + Elections
      + newer versions defer to older ones in DC elections 
        (opposite of current behavior)
      + this means that only once the complete cluster has been upgraded will
        we start acting like the new version and accept new config options
      + it also means newer PE's and TE's (the most complex pieces) don't need
        "act like the old version" options and can rely on all slaves being at
        least as up-to-date as they are
      + people can run mixed clusters as long as they want
        (until they want the new PE features)
      + new DCs only update the version number in the CIB if they have a 
        higher value
      + nodes that start and have a lower version than that stored in the CIB
        shut themselves down (the CRM part anyway)
      + this prevents an admin from introducing old nodes back into an upgraded
        cluster. It probably doesn't fully understand the config and may not

    the DC when basic CIB schema versions differ.  It now prefers
    the older version to be DC instead of the newer version.

* Wed Sep 14 2005  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.1 - 
  + Communication Layer
    + netstring encoding format is changed to be more efficient
    + add compression capability for big messages
  + Add man pages for hb_standby/hb_takeover	
  + The assert triggered by 2.0.0 has been fixed

  + Detection of failed nodes by the Policy Engine is fixed
  + New Policy Engine features 
    http://www.linux-ha.org/ClusterResourceManager/DTD1.0/Annotated :
      sections 1.5.[8,9,10,12]
    + Constraints and instance attributes can now be active conditionally
    + Rules can now contain other rules
    + Date/Time based expressions are supported
    + Cloned resources can now optionally be notified before and after
      any of its peers are stopped or started.
    + The cluster can re-evaluate the configuration automatically after
      a defined interval of idleness
  + Removed a flow control message which was very annoying when operating
    in a mixed 1.x/2.x environment
  -- Known Bugs :-( --
    - Bug 859 - FSA took too long to complete action - fully recovered from
    - Bug 882 - IPC channel not connected during shutdown - harmless
    - Bug 879 - Failed actions cause extra election - harmless
 Each of these occurs about once or twice in 5000 test iterations
       - This is probably > 10K failovers
    - rsc_location constraints cannot have rules that contain other rules
      (fixed in CVS after release) 
* Fri Jul 29 2005  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 2.0.0 - First stable release of the next generation of the Linux-HA project
  + Basic Characteristics described here:
	http://linux-ha.org/FactSheetv2
  + Core infrastructure improvments:
    + Messaging (message acknowledging and flow control)
    + Logging   (logging daemon)
  + Release 1.x style (2-node) clusters fully supported
  + Multi-node support (so far up to 16-node clusters tested)
	See http://linux-ha.org/GettingStartedV2 for more information
  + New components:
    + Cluster Information Base    (replicated resource configuration)
    + Cluster Resource Manager    (supporting 1->N nodes)
    + Modular Policy Engine       (controlling resource placement)
    + Local Resource Manager      (policy free, not cluster aware)
    + Stonith Daemon              (stand-alone fencing  subsytem)
  + Support for OCF and LSB resource agents
  + Support for composite resource types (groups, clones)
  + Support for a rich set of resource location and ordering constraints
  + Conversion tool for existing haresources
  + Resources monitored by request
  + Resource "maintenance" mode
  + Several failback, failure and "No Quorum" behaviours to choose from
        (global defaults and per action or resource)
  + Sample cluster state and configuration monitoring tools

  Known issues in 2.0.0:
    - Under some rare circumstances the cluster manager will time out
      while stabilizing a new cluster state.  This appears to be
	otherwise harmless - the cluster is actually fine.
	http://www.osdl.org/developer_bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=770
    - Under some rare circumstances, a dev assert will be triggered
	in unpack.c.  This results in the pengine getting restarted.
	This is annoying, but not a disaster.

  + All STABLE changes noted below have been ported to this branch
  + Included in this release is a beta of the next generation of Heartbeat
	resource manager developed by Andrew Beekhof.  
	http://linuxha.trick.ca/NewHeartbeatDesign is a good place to learn
	more about this effort. Please examine crm/README, crm/test/README
	and crm/crm-1.0.dtd for example usage and configuration.
  + Also included is the L(ocal) R(esource) M(anager) developed by IBM China
	which is an integral part of the NewHeartbeatDesign.
  + Known caveats:
    - STONITH as a whole has seen a code cleanup and should be tested
      carefully.
    - The external STONITH plug-in has undergone major surgery and
      probably doesn't work yet.
    - the new CRM is not perfectly stable with 3 nodes yet.
  + PLEASE see http://osdl.org/developer_bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=Linux-HA
    and use it to report quirks and issues you find!

	THIS OBSOLETES THE NICE_FAILBACK OPTION. READ THE DOCS FOR HOW
	TO UPGRADE SMOOTHLY.
  + Added a new feature to hb_standby which allows you to give up
	  any specific category of resources:  local, foreign, or all.
	The old behavior is "all" which is the default.

	  an active/active configuration on demand.
  + ipfail now works properly with auto_failback on (active/active)

	to a network failure, but waits a little while so that the
	damage can be properly assessed and extraneous takeovers avoided

  + SIGNIFICANT amount of internal rearchitecture.
  + Many bug fixes.
  + Several documentation updates.

* Tue Feb 10 2004  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 1.1.5
  + ipfail now has "hysteresis" so that it doesn't respond immediately

  + More fixes to the IPC code - especially handling data reception
	after EOF
  + removed some unclean code from GSource for treating EOF conditions

  + Fixed the cl_poll() code to handle corner cases better
  + Made heartbeat close watchdog device before re-execing itself
  + New CTS improvements from Mi, Jun <jun.mi@intel.com>
  + Various minor bug fixes.
      . Several shutdown bugs addressed
      . fixed sendarp to make a pid file, so we can shut it down
          when we shut everything else down in case it's still running.
      . Lots of minor bug fixes to IPC code
      . Lots of minor bug fixes to ipctest program
      . made BasicSanityCheck more tolerant of delays
      . Fixed IPC code to authenticate based on ints, not int*s.
      . Check properly for strnlen instead of strlen...
      . Several signed/unsigned fixes
      . A few uninitialized vars now are inited
      . Switched to compiling lex/yacc sources the automake way
      . Lots of minor CTS fixes...

  + ldirectord bug fixes:
    . When new real servers are added on initialisation or when
        the configuration file is reread they are marked with status
        of -1 (uninitialised) so they will be checked and inserted
        into the virtual service as required
    . All checks use the checkport if set, otherwise the port set for
        the individual real server. This was the case for http and
        connect checks, but others had variations on this theme.
    . When the configuration file is reread because it changed
        on disk and autoreload is set, check the real servers
        immediately rather than waiting for checkinterval to expire
    . Already running message sent to stderr instead of stdout
    . Support alternate server in real-server specific URL
    . Treat the same real server with different weights as a different
        real server. Fixes bug reported by Philip Hayward whereby the same
        real-server would always have the same weight, regardless of
        the ldirectord.cf

* Fri Sep 26 2003  Alan Robertson <alanr@unix.sh> (see doc/AUTHORS file)
+ Version 1.1.3
  + Bugfix for heartbeat starting resources twice concurrently if
    auto_failback was set to "legacy".

    names properly when current node not found in the ha.cf file
  + Send a message to the cluster whenever we have a node which doesn't
    need STONITHing - even though it's gone down.  This fix needed

  + Changed the default port number to our official IANA port number (694)
  + Regularized more messages, eliminated some redundant ones.
  + Print the version of heartbeat when starting.

  + An empty /etc/ha.d/conf/ is now part of the rpm distribution
    as this is where ldirectord's configuration belongs (Horms)
  + Minor startup script tweaks.  Hopefully, we should be able to make core
    files should we crash in the future.  Thanks to Holger Kiehl for diagnosing
    the problem!
  + Fixed a bug which kept the "logfile" option from ever working.

        by Lars Marowsky-Bree
  + Incorporated patch from Guenther Thomsen to implement locking for
        serial ports used for heartbeats

	of the string in ResourceManager resulting in some bad calls later on.
  +  Made it compliant with the FHS (filesystem hierarchy standard)
  +  Fixed IP address takeover so we can take over on non-eth0 interface
  +  Fixed IP takeover code so we can specify netmasks and broadcast addrs,
	or default them at the user's option.

	into the uniform resource model, and removing some restrictions.
  + Preliminary "Getting Started" document by Rudy Pawul
  + Improved the /proc/ha code
  + Fixed memory leak associated with serial ports, and problem with return
	of control to the "master" node.
	(Thanks to Holger Kiehl for reporting them, and testing fixes!)
