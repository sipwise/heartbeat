Subject: OCF-resources: SphinxSearchDaemon is not installed

Hi, All.

Congratulations to release Heartbeat 2.1.3.

I read Alan's release mail and made own rpm package. So, I was aware
of difference that SphinxSearchDaemon RA is not installed. And I
attached the simply patch file and please confirm.
